# Feature Requests

Help shape the future of Hackmamba by requesting new features and improvements.

## How to Submit Feature Requests

### GitHub Issues (Recommended)

Submit feature requests through GitHub Issues:

1. **Search existing issues** - Check if your request already exists
2. **Use the template** - Use our feature request template
3. **Provide details** - Include use case, examples, and impact
4. **Vote and discuss** - Engage with the community

### Other Channels

- **Discord** - Share ideas in `#feature-requests`
- **Email** - Send to features@hackmamba.com
- **Community Survey** - Participate in quarterly surveys

## Feature Request Template

```markdown
## Feature Description

Brief description of the feature you'd like to see.

## Problem Statement

What problem does this feature solve? What pain point does it address?

## Proposed Solution

How should this feature work? What would the user experience be like?

## Use Cases

Describe specific scenarios where this feature would be valuable:

- Use case 1: [Description]
- Use case 2: [Description]
- Use case 3: [Description]

## Alternatives Considered

What other solutions have you considered? Why is this approach better?

## Additional Context

Any other context, mockups, or examples that would help explain the feature.
```

## Feature Request Examples

### Good Feature Request

````markdown
## Feature Description

Add webhook retry configuration to allow custom retry policies.

## Problem Statement

Currently, webhooks retry 3 times with fixed intervals (1min, 5min, 15min). Our application needs different retry behavior - we want to retry more times with shorter intervals for critical events.

## Proposed Solution

Add a `retry_policy` field to webhook configuration:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/webhook",
  "events": ["payment.succeeded"],
  "retry_policy": {
    "max_attempts": 10,
    "intervals": [30, 60, 120, 300, 600], // seconds
    "backoff": "exponential"
  }
}
```
````

## Use Cases

- Critical payment notifications need immediate retry
- Different retry policies for different event types
- Custom backoff strategies for specific applications

## Alternatives Considered

- Using a message queue (adds complexity)
- Implementing retry logic in our application (redundant)
- Accepting current retry behavior (not suitable for our needs)

## Additional Context

This would be especially valuable for financial applications where delayed notifications can impact user experience.

### API Feature Request

```markdown
## Feature Description
Add bulk operations for user management.

## Problem Statement
We need to update hundreds of users at once (e.g., changing user roles during a migration). Currently, we have to make individual API calls, which is slow and hits rate limits.

## Proposed Solution
Add bulk endpoints:
- `POST /v1/users/bulk-update` - Update multiple users
- `POST /v1/users/bulk-delete` - Delete multiple users
- `POST /v1/users/bulk-create` - Create multiple users

## Use Cases
- User role migrations
- Bulk user imports
- Account cleanup operations
- Data synchronization

## Alternatives Considered
- Using individual API calls (current approach - too slow)
- Using webhooks to trigger bulk operations (complex)
- Implementing our own bulk operations (redundant)

## Additional Context
This would significantly improve our migration processes and reduce API calls.

## Feature Prioritization

### How We Prioritize Features

We consider several factors when prioritizing features:

- **User Impact** - How many users would benefit?
- **Business Value** - Does it align with our goals?
- **Technical Effort** - How complex is it to implement?
- **User Demand** - How many requests do we receive?
- **Strategic Fit** - Does it fit our roadmap?

### Priority Levels

- **P0 - Critical** - Security issues, breaking changes
- **P1 - High** - Major features, significant improvements
- **P2 - Medium** - Important features, nice-to-have improvements
- **P3 - Low** - Minor features, future considerations
