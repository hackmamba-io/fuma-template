## Feedback Guidelines

### Be Specific

Instead of:

> "The API is hard to use"

Say:

> "The user creation endpoint requires too many optional fields, making it confusing to know what's required"

### Provide Context

- **Use case** - What are you trying to accomplish?
- **Environment** - What's your setup?
- **Impact** - How does this affect your work?

### Suggest Solutions

When possible, suggest solutions:

- **Alternative approaches** - How could this work better?

- **Priorities** - How important is this to you?

## Feedback Examples

### Good Feedback

## Feature Request: Batch User Creation

### Use Case

We need to create hundreds of users at once during our onboarding process. Currently, we have to make individual API calls for each user, which is slow and hits rate limits.

### Current Workaround

We're using Promise.all() with individual API calls, but this often fails due to rate limiting.

### Proposed Solution

Add a batch endpoint like POST /v1/users/batch that accepts an array of user objects and returns an array of results.

### Example API

```json
POST /v1/users/batch
{
  "users": [
    {"name": "User 1", "email": "user1@example.com"},
    {"name": "User 2", "email": "user2@example.com"}
  ]
}
```

### Priority

High - This would significantly improve our onboarding process.

### Documentation Feedback

## Documentation Issue: Missing Error Codes

### Problem
The API reference doesn't list all possible error codes. When we get a 400 error, we don't know what specific error code to handle.

### Location
/docs/api-reference - Error Handling section

### Suggested Fix
Add a complete list of error codes with descriptions and examples.

### Example
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_email_format",
    "message": "The email address format is invalid",
    "field": "email"
  }
}
````
