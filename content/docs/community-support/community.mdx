````
Subject: API returning 401 error when creating users

I'm trying to create users using the JavaScript SDK but getting a 401 error.

Environment:
- SDK: @hackmamba/sdk v1.2.3
- Environment: sandbox
- Node.js: v18.0.0

Code:
```javascript
const client = new HackmambaClient({
  apiKey: process.env.HACKMAMBA_API_KEY
});

const user = await client.users.create({
  name: 'Test User',
  email: 'test@example.com'
});
````

Error:

```
Error: Invalid API key
```

I've verified my API key is correct and starts with `sk_test_`. Any ideas?

```
