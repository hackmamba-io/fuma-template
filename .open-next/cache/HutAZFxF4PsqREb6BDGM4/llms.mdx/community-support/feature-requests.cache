What pain point does it address?\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nHow should this feature work? What would the user experience be like?\n\n## Use Cases\n\nDescribe specific scenarios where this feature would be valuable:\n\n- Use case 1: [Description]\n- Use case 2: [Description]\n- Use case 3: [Description]\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\nWhat other solutions have you considered? Why is this approach better?\n\n## Additional Context\n\nAny other context, mockups, or examples that would help explain the feature.\n```\n\n## Feature Request Examples\n\n### Good Feature Request\n\n````markdown\n## Feature Description\n\nAdd webhook retry configuration to allow custom retry policies.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nCurrently, webhooks retry 3 times with fixed intervals (1min, 5min, 15min). Our application needs different retry behavior - we want to retry more times with shorter intervals for critical events.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd a `retry_policy` field to webhook configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://example.com/webhook\",\n  \"events\": [\"payment.succeeded\"],\n  \"retry_policy\": {\n    \"max_attempts\": 10,\n    \"intervals\": [30, 60, 120, 300, 600], // seconds\n    \"backoff\": \"exponential\"\n  }\n}\n```\n````\n\n## Use Cases\n\n* Critical payment notifications need immediate retry\n* Different retry policies for different event types\n* Custom backoff strategies for specific applications\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n* Using a message queue (adds complexity)\n* Implementing retry logic in our application (redundant)\n* Accepting current retry behavior (not suitable for our needs)\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThis would be especially valuable for financial applications where delayed notifications can impact user experience.\n\n````\n\n### API Feature Request\n\n```markdown\n## Feature Description\nAdd bulk operations for user management.\n\n## Problem Statement\nWe need to update hundreds of users at once (e.g., changing user roles during a migration). Currently, we have to make individual API calls, which is slow and hits rate limits.\n\n## Proposed Solution\nAdd bulk endpoints:\n- `POST /v1/users/bulk-update` - Update multiple users\n- `POST /v1/users/bulk-delete` - Delete multiple users\n- `POST /v1/users/bulk-create` - Create multiple users\n\n## Use Cases\n- User role migrations\n- Bulk user imports\n- Account cleanup operations\n- Data synchronization\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n- Using individual API calls (current approach - too slow)\n- Using webhooks to trigger bulk operations (complex)\n- Implementing our own bulk operations (redundant)\n\n## Additional Context\nThis would significantly improve our migration processes and reduce API calls.\n````\n\n## Feature Prioritization\n\n### How We Prioritize Features\n\nWe consider several factors when prioritizing features:\n\n* **User Impact** - How many users would benefit?\n* **Business Value** - Does it align with our goals?\n* **Technical Effort** - How complex is it to implement?\n* **User Demand** - How many requests do we receive?\n* **Strategic Fit** - Does it fit our roadmap?\n\n### Priority Levels\n\n* **P0 - Critical** - Security issues, breaking changes\n* **P1 - High** - Major features, significant improvements\n* **P2 - Medium** - Important features, nice-to-have improvements\n* **P3 - Low** - Minor features, future considerations\n\n## Voting and Discussion\n\n### Voting on Features\n\n* **GitHub Issues** - Use üëç reactions to vote\n* **Discord** - React with emojis to show support\n* **Surveys** - Participate in formal voting\n\n### Discussing Features\n\n* **GitHub Discussions** - Detailed discussions\n* **Discord** - Real-time chat\n* **Community Calls** - Monthly feature discussions\n\n## Feature Status\n\n### Status Tracking\n\nWe track feature requests through these statuses:\n\n* **Under Review** - Being evaluated by product team\n* **Planned** - Approved and planned for development\n* **In Development** - Currently being built\n* **Beta Testing** - Available for testing\n* **Released** - Available in production\n* **Rejected** - Not planned for implementation\n\n### Status Updates\n\n* **Monthly updates** - Status changes posted to GitHub\n* **Release notes** - New features announced\n* **Beta announcements** - Early access opportunities\n\n## Current Roadmap\n\n### Q1 2024\n\n* [ ] Bulk user operations\n* [ ] Enhanced webhook configuration\n* [ ] Improved error messages\n\n### Q2 2024\n\n* [ ] GraphQL API\n* [ ] Real-time subscriptions\n* [ ] Advanced analytics\n\n### Q3 2024\n\n* [ ] Mobile SDKs\n* [ ] Plugin marketplace\n* [ ] Advanced security features\n\n## Contributing to Features\n\n### Implementation\n\nWant to help implement a feature?\n\n1. **Check the roadmap** - See what's planned\n2. **Look for \"help wanted\"** labels on GitHub Issues\n3. **Contact maintainers** - Discuss implementation approach\n4. **Submit PR** - Follow contribution guidelines\n\n### Design and UX\n\nHelp with design and user experience:\n\n* **Mockups** - Create visual designs\n* **User flows** - Design user journeys\n* **Accessibility** - Ensure inclusive design\n* **Testing** - Participate in usability testing\n\n## Feature Request Best Practices\n\n### Before Submitting\n\n1. **Search existing requests** - Avoid duplicates\n2. **Check roadmap** - See if already planned\n3. **Gather feedback** - Discuss with community first\n4. **Prepare details** - Have use cases and examples ready\n\n### Writing Effective Requests\n\n* **Be specific** - Clear description of what you want\n* **Explain the problem** - Why is this needed?\n* **Provide examples** - Show how it would work\n* **Consider alternatives** - What else could work?\n\n### Following Up\n\n* **Vote on others** - Support related requests\n* **Provide feedback** - Help refine the feature\n* **Test betas** - Help test implementations\n* **Share use cases** - Provide real-world examples\n\n## Community Feature Requests\n\n### Popular Requests\n\nBased on community voting:\n\n1. **Bulk Operations** - Batch API calls\n2. **GraphQL API** - More flexible querying\n3. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket connections\n4. **Mobile SDKs** - Native mobile support\n5. **Advanced Analytics** - Better insights\n\n### Recent Additions\n\nFeatures added based on community requests:\n\n* **Webhook retry configuration** - Custom retry policies\n* **Enhanced error messages** - More helpful error details\n* **Rate limit headers** - Better rate limit visibility\n* **SDK improvements** - Better developer experience\n\n<Cards>\n  <Card title=\"Community\" href=\"/docs/community\" description=\"Join our developer community\" />\n\n  <Card title=\"Feedback\" href=\"/docs/feedback\" description=\"Share your feedback\" />\n\n  <Card title=\"Contributing\" href=\"/docs/contributing\" description=\"Contribute to the project\" />\n</Cards>\n"}
